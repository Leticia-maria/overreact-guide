# Introduction

**overreact** is a library for creating and analyzing microkinetic models.
Data is parsed directly from computational chemistry output files thanks to
[`cclib`](https://cclib.github.io/).

Free energies are calculated using the quasi-rigid rotor harmonic oscillator
method and the resulting data used in the automatic prediction of reaction
rate constants.
Quantum tunneling effects are taken into account using either the
Eckart or Wigner models.
Chemical reaction networks are subsequently simulated over time.
