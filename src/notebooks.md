# Jupyter notebooks

We provide a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that you
can use to explore the application programming interface (API) and learn more
about using **overreact** as a Python library. The example notebooks are
available in the
[`notebooks` folder at GitHub](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/tree/master/notebooks).
The following notebooks are available:

-   [Simulation basics](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/simulation/1%20basic%20reaction%20simulation.ipynb)
-   [An (artificial) Michaelis-Menten example](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/simulation/2%20basic%20michaelis-menten%20simulation.ipynb)
-   [An automatic, first-principles, Arrhenius plot](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/hydrogen-abstraction/1%20Arrhenius%20plot.ipynb)
-   [A simple acid-base equilibria](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/5%20pH.ipynb)
-   [A first-principles, gas phase microkinetic model](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/hydrogen-abstraction/2%20microkinetics.ipynb)
-   [How to access the QRRHO implementation](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact-guide/blob/master/notebooks/7%20QRRHO.ipynb)

> **ðŸ’¬** If you have any questions about the notebooks, don't hesitate to
